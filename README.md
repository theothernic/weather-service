# WeatherService

## What is this?
Integrating a bunch of frea weather API into one big superpackage 
for ease of use. (And also because I had a wild hair.)

## Laravel .env variables

Make sure that you include the following entries in your .env file; they 
control which services to set up in the service provider.

```
NOAA_ENABLED=false

OPENWEATHERMAP_ENABLED=false
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=""
```
